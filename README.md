[Arkanoid with processing, arduino on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YjE0HqZCjfQ)


Many people requested to send their code through YouTube and e-mail, so I decided to post this on GitHub.
I wrote this code few years ago, for my college class project. I knew nothing about programming then. It is bad. :P
Never copy and paste the code to your assignment! You know it is not good for you. :)
Please just take this for an example.
Hope this to be helpful to your learning.

Jaeil.
