[Arkanoid with processing, arduino on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YjE0HqZCjfQ)

Many people requested to send them the source code through YouTube and e-mail, so I decided to post this on GitHub.
I wrote this code few years ago, for my college class project, when I just started programming.
This code is not good, but I want you to have an example of begginer level student.
Hope this to be helpful to your learning. :)

Never copy and paste the code to your assignment, That is no good. :P

Good luck!
Jaeil.
